#Floyd-Warshall in Parallel with MPI

Parallel implementation (in **C**) of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm through Fox algorithm using **MPI**.

To compile, just run **make** command in the folder. You'll need to define a file with your cluster configuration before you run.

To run the programm you'll need to input the size of the matrix before the matrix itself.

**Example of input**
```
